    numerical validation.

    The system allocates cached microbatch data and expert IDs as the warmup
    queue fills to delay_steps entries (one optimizer step per entry). Memory
    usage therefore grows with delay_steps; an oversized warmup can exhaust
    available memory and cause OOM: microbatches consume CPU memory (including
    pinned memory when supplied by the loader), while expert IDs consume device memory.
    ACTIVE prefetch temporarily holds one additional step before dequeuing.
