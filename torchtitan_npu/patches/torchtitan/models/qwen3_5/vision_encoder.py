"""Backport the NPU-safe Qwen3.5 vision boundaries to pinned TorchTitan.

Upstream PR: pending publication of the Qwen3.5 vision-mask fix.
Upstream base: ``b175497ea3502388bb9513391810a86ca46dbfa8``.

The mask builder and FSDP module boundary are fixed before a model Config can
replace them, so a late Config override is insufficient. Remove when the
pinned upstream revision builds masks eagerly off CUDA and returns an owning
vision-encoder output.

Still required as of 2026-09-16: upstream wires vision mask creation through
``torch.compile(create_block_mask)`` even in eager runs, and under CANN 9.0.0
(what ``/usr/local/Ascend/cann`` resolves to on the dev container, selected
first by the launcher env chain) that compiled wrapper fails to build while
the eager path works. Only mask creation bypasses compile here; model-body
compilation (aot_eager / inductor-ascendc) is unaffected.
