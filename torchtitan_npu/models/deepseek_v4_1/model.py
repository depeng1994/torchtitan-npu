"""DeepSeek V4.1 backbones: the text stack and its multimodal extension.

Shape legend for this file:
    B = batch, L = sequence length, D = model dimension, hc = ``hc_mult`` residual
    branches.

:class:`DeepSeekV41Model` is the text-only backbone — a plain
:class:`torchtitan.models.common.decoder.Decoder` with no MTP depths and no vision
tower.  :class:`DeepSeekV41MultimodalModel` subclasses it and adds the vision tower, the
image markers and the modality-routing bias; the only things that differ are the input
embedding construction and whether an ``image_mask`` reaches the block, so the text
stack carries no vision parameter, no vision branch and no vision import.

The block carries the residual stream as ``hc`` parallel branches and threads the
cross-layer attention state (compressed KV, index keys, selected entries, student
logits, candidate pool) explicitly: an attention source layer returns the tensors it
produced, every other layer returns what it was handed.  That keeps the reuse structure
visible in the forward signature instead of in mutable module state, at the cost of a
longer tuple.

Single-Pass mHC means each sublayer collapses its input with the mixing coefficients
predicted by the *previous* sublayer, so the block returns the coefficients its
successor needs.  The stack has no learned output head: the model collapses the
branches with the last block's coefficients and feeds the result straight to the output
norm.

Packed documents are described by :class:`DeepSeekV41Metadata`: the only per-token varlen
metadata is a document id per token, which both Attention Gym's operator (window branch)
and the indexer (entry-axis isolation) derive their masks from, and the indexer's
selection masks are precomputed from it once per forward.
