"""Compressed main KV for DeepSeek V4.1 (CSA2).

Shape legend for this file:
    B = batch, L = sequence length, D = model dimension, R = ``compress_ratio``,
    Dk = head dimension of a compressed KV entry (``head_dim``).

Every layer owns a :class:`Compressor` instance, but only the *source* layers
carry parameters: a layer whose compressed KV is produced elsewhere holds no
weights and simply returns the tensor it was handed.  ``is_source`` encodes that
contract and is asserted in ``forward``, so a misconfigured layer fails loudly
instead of silently compressing or silently passing through.

Entry ``j`` of the compressed KV stands for the ``R`` tokens of group ``j``, so
it takes the position of the group's first token for RoPE.  The compressed KV is
rotated here rather than in the attention module, because the indexer needs the
*un-rotated* latent: CSA2 projects indexer keys from the main KV latent, so both
consumers need a different view of the same pooling result.

The pooling is a softmax-gated sum over each group; the norm and the rope are the
modules the config builds, with the rope's prefix width set by the site.
